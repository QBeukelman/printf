## Usage

#### Requirements

The functions are written in C language and therefore require the `gcc` **compiler** and some **standard C libraries** to run.

#### Instructions

#### 1. Compile the library

To compile, go to the library path directory and run:

```bash
  make
```

```bash
  make bonus
```
```bash
  make clean
```
```bash
  gcc main.c -L. libftprintf.a && ./a.out
```

#### 2. Use the library

Include the following header to your `.c` file:

```c
  #include "ft_printf.h"
```

## Testing

You can use this third party tester to measure the capability of the library:
